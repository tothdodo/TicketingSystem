# Falco Basketball Club website with TicketingSystem by tothdodo

## Preview

A responsive website for a basketball club named **Falco KC Szombathely**. News feed, team check and ticket buy using seat-clicking options are available. Ticket purchases are saved into an **SQL Database** and **SignalR** is used to avoid transaction axioms. **Angular** frontend communicates with the data access layer by calling WebAPI endpoints which were created with **ASP.NET Core Framework**.

Still under construction, but has a lot of valuable functions.
